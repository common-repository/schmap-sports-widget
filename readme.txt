== Installation ==

Requirement:

  The Wordpress Sidebar Widgets Plugin must be installed. This plugin has been integrated into the official Wordpress release since version 2.2, so if your version of Wordpress is 2.2 or later, then you don't need to do anything for this. If you have a version of Wordpress before 2.2, then the Wordpress Sidebar Widgets Plugin must be installed manually. It can be downloaded from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widgets/.

To install the Schmap widget, follow the steps below:
1. Unzip the plugin package. This will create a directory called 'schmap-widget' containing the following files: 
README.txt
schmap-widget.php

2. Copy the 'schmap-widget' directory into your Wordpress plugins directory: /your_path/wordpress/wp-content/plugins
(where 'your_path' is the path to your Wordpress installation)

3. Ensure that you have permission to read and execute the files provided in the plugin. For example, if you have Linux, use the command:
chmod -R 755 /your_path/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/schmap-widget/*  

4. Run your Wordpress Administration panel (http://your-wordpress-url/wp-admin/) in your Browser, and select the 'Plugins' tab at the top. Your Schmap plugin should be visible; click on the 'Activate' option and you're ready to add a Schmap Widget to your blog!
